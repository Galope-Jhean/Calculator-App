### This is a simple program I created using C++. 

A Calculator with a modern design inspired by</br>
one of the challenges from frontendmentor.io

This app can basically do anything a simple calculator would do

It can:

* Add
* Subtract
* Divide
* Multiply 

It is like I said, a basic calculator.

.exe files are available within the x64 folder.
